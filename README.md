# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java. It's a command-line game where players take turns to mark cells on a 3x3 grid. The game follows the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using Java.

## Java and OOP Principles

As I delve into Java programming, I've encountered this game, which provides a practical demonstration of key OOP principles:

1. **Classes and Objects:** I've structured the game into classes representing the game board and the overall game. Objects of these classes interact to manage the game state.

2. **Encapsulation:** Each class encapsulates its data and functionality. For instance, the `TicTacToe` class manages the game logic while the `Board` class handles the game board.

### Challenges

In my journey to understand Java and OOP concepts, I've faced several challenges:

- **Understanding OOP:** It took me some time to grasp concepts like classes, objects, and encapsulation.
  
- **Managing State:** Ensuring the game progresses correctly based on player inputs and detecting win/draw conditions posed a challenge.
  
- **Input Validation:** Validating user input to prevent errors was crucial. I had to ensure valid row and column numbers for the game.
  
- **Testing and Debugging:** Testing the game thoroughly and debugging any issues that arose were crucial steps in software development.

## Conclusion

Through working on this Tic Tac Toe game, I've gained insights into Java programming and OOP concepts. It has provided me with a practical platform to enhance my understanding and improve my programming skills.
