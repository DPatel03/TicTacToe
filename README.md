# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java. It's a command-line game where players take turns to mark cells on a 3x3 grid. The game follows the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using Java.

## Java and OOP Principles

Java is a popular programming language known for its simplicity and platform independence. This game showcases key OOP principles:

1. **Classes and Objects:** The game is organized into classes representing the game board and the overall game. Objects of these classes interact to manage the game state.

2. **Encapsulation:** Each class encapsulates its data and functionality. For example, the `TicTacToe` class manages the game logic while the `Board` class handles the game board.

### Challenges

Understanding Java and OOP concepts:

**Understanding OOP:** Getting familiar with concepts like classes, objects, and encapsulation might take some time.
  
**Managing State:** Ensuring the game progresses correctly based on player inputs and detecting win/draw conditions can be challenging.
  
**Input Validation:** Validating user input to prevent errors is important. In this game, ensuring valid row and column numbers is essential.
  
**Testing and Debugging:** Testing the game thoroughly and debugging any issues that arise are crucial steps in software development.

## Conclusion

This Tic Tac Toe game provides a simple introduction to Java programming and OOP concepts. By working with this code, you can gain a better understanding of OOP principles and improve your programming skills.
